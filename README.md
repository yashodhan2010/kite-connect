1.  Create a profile on https://zerodha.com/products/api/ to get an API key.
2.  Create an app and find API KEY and API secret
3.  Copy the KEY and SECRET onto a config.py file

## The to get the request token
1.  Once you click on the URL suggested by the CLI, authorise with zerodha details if asked and copy the key/text after "request_token=" in the URL.
2.  Enter the key and then run the rest of the code
3.  Now you can buy or sell order from the code line

## The purpose of the code is to get you a connection to place buy and sell order to then build your own strategy.
